Nestled in the hills of central Germany lies a town of the name Marburg. Here, in June of 2019, I had a 2 week German language course that remain as one of my favorite and most influential periods from the summer. Known as a university town, Marburg also bears a fairy tale identity. The famous authors of Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Little Red Riding Hood, and many many more known as the Brothers Grimm attended the University of Marburg, and their influence can be seen around the town. Various fantastical features mark the path of the Fairy Tale Route, including the Brothers' old house. The most outstanding feature of the town, however, goes to the castle on a hill that can be seen nearly anywhere in town. Leading up to the castle, shops and stone paths all fall into the character of a fantasy medieval environment. While this added a lot of charm to my experience here, the fairy tale aspects are hardly the reason why I enjoyed it so much.

## Getting There

To get to Marburg I took a long distance train for the first time since arriving in Germany, and it was no less stressful. First I took one from Bonn to Mainz, no big deal. From Mainz I was to go to Frankfurt, but the train was delayed. When I arrived in Frankfurt, I had to run to catch my connection from Frankfurt to Marburg. I got to the right platform and the departure time was correct, but the signs on the train and its destination didn't match with my ticket. Freaked out, I started looking around and asking people what was going on. Eventually, one lady assured me I was on the right train. Apparently at one of the stops, the train splits in two. The front end goes in one direction and the back takes another route. I was on the back half, and the front was headed to Marburg. On that splitting stop, I simply got out of the train and went to the front half.

While I was still stressed out, this final stretch of the ride was beautiful. It was the first time I had seen German plains. Rolling hills and windmills passed by the high speed train until building started poking up. After getting off at the Marburg main station, I cautiously walked to the language place, which gave me directions to a home with a host. I had signed up for a hostel so having a host had me worried yet again.

## A German Home

From the moment I arrived at my homestay, my stresses were released. After a short taxi ride, I pulled up to a cute house hidden behind various trees and plants. I was welcomed at the door by my host, and we had little cakes. My room for the fortnight was the attic. It was a pleasant, bright space with its own washroom. The floor below me was for a student who rented there; she studied piano and was from Spain. This floor had its own kitchen, dining area, and deck. The main floor had the main dining area, a porch out to the garden, a living room with two pianos, and a study. Finally, the basement, which I never saw, was the living space for my host.

I was welcomed and fed very well. We had dinner together each day, with a dessert and dishwashing to follow. We were able to eat outside a few times, and I got to experience a wide variety of meals. Some of the foods we had were spargel (white asparagus), wurst, potatoes, sushi, cheese on bread, meat on cantaloupe, a Spanish tortilla, pasta, and lots more.  

In this house I felt more at home than I had been yet in my summer. I was able to sit in the lovely garden, listen to an exceptional pianist, have my own washroom, and just get to know nice people. We spent time playing cards, chatting, and learning to dance. These moments stand out as some of my favorite memories from the summer.

## The Language Course

The actual reason I was in Marburg, the language course itself was a very difference experience than I anticipated. Some of us called it more of a social experience than anything. There were maybe a dozen of us interns who all came to Marburg for this course, and I was able to become friends with, or even just share nice experiences with, them. We had a teacher who walked us through a variety of topics from greetings to numbers, the alphabet to food, and verbs to household objects. It was cool to see the workings of the German language, but it sure did not click for me. Luckily others had a similarity difficult time, and we were able to have fun with it. That involved latched onto specific words we liked to use all the time. We learned a lot of German life in that class: etiquette, workers rights (guaranteed 20 days paid vacation), and all sorts of stuff.

Class started in the morning, with a "pause" (break) in the middle, then finished off at noon. After we would all find lunch and figure out something to do for the rest of the day. These activities took us all over town getting ice cream, viewing the castle, seeing many flowers, and climbing to a tower for a view of the city. I did a lot of walking, not even taking transit to and from the course, but there was always interesting things to see, making it all worth it.

## Kassel

One of the weekends, the language course set up a trip for us to the nearby city of Kassel, where there is the Bergpark Wilhelmsh√∂he, a UNESCO world heritage site. This is a large park with a path that winds up a hill to a towering Hercules monument. It's a park that, at the time of its construction in the late 1600s, was an imitation of ancient Greek architecture made by a rich dude. The whole park is actually a "fake" with artificial steams and "broken" aqueducts, but since it is so old, it has essentially become "real" over time.

We entered the park at the bottom of a hill, with a clear view to the very top of the tower. As we made our way upwards there were bridges that crossed dry stream beds and curated greenspaces between the surrounding trees. Once we made it to the foot of the monument, the journey had just begun. Many stone stairs led to the top, with various statues of mythological Greek figures rewarding us at each stage. From the very top, a clear path exposed the entire park and continued to cut straight through to overlook the city of Kassel.

We stopped for lunch at a restaurant just at the foot of the monument, and I was able to get a couple of good, cheap wurst dogs. Normally at this stage you get to a point where the view is enough and you endure a walk through all the things you just saw in order to leave the area. While we did take essentially the same route to leave the park, it was much different this time. Twice a week they send water rushing through the whole park. It begins by shooting out a fountain at the top of the monument before cascading down the stairs, sneaking into the forest through the previously dry stream beds, under the bridges, down a waterfall, and over the aqueducts, before finally launching out of a massive geyser in the lake at the beginning of the park.

The other visitors were hardly noticeable on our way up, but once the water started running, crowds gathered at each stage to witness the path of the water. It was quite the event.

## National Park

One of my more unexpected outings of the summer, a daytrip to Kellerwald Endersee national park was a big highlight. Going into the summer, I was planning my experiences around various cities and tourist attractions, so a park in the countryside was not on that list. However, with the suggestion of some others in the language course, I ended up in one anyways, and it was fantastic.

We started the day off getting a group train pass to the park, where we first went to the visitors center. There we planned out our route and headed off. It began in farming fields but we soon got into the trees where the path began to ascend. The trees opened up in places to a view of the valley down below. After some time and various ups and downs, the trail steeply descended and eventually opened up to a small lakeside community nestled in the park. Considering it was a hot summer day, swimming in a cool lake provided delight in the middle of a hike.

We spent some time there and ate afterwards before heading back into the forest. We chatted until the path opened up to rolling green hills of poppies. Eventually we got back to the information center and caught the train back to Marburg, and I was just in time for spargel.

## After the Fortnight

I learnt a bit of German for sure, but the connections and memories I made in a literal fairy tale town remain some of the greatest highlights of my internship. Being with others made me more comfortable in the foreign environment, which was something I was able to take back to Bonn with me.
