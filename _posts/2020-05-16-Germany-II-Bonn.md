It has officially been a year since I arrived in Germany, and a lot has changed, so I really need to get going on this series...

To really transition into Germany living, I needed to explore what Bonn had to offer, and the first things to see were, of course, the tourist attractions. After seeing the city square, I had to venture out a little further this time. However, I soon found that some of the most enjoyable aspects of another country are the little things.

## A Hike

When you look up Bonn, one of the first images to come up is generally the Schloss Drachenburg: a castle on a hill above the city. Naturally, I had to go to it. One of my first weekends living in Bonn, I did just that, taking the U-Bahn (subway), to cross the city from station to station to reach the bottom of the hill.

At the bottom of the hill sits a tram that goes up, but there is also a path, so I opted to take a hike. Now, it was a hot summer in Europe of 2019 and parts of the climb were pretty steep, so it was tiresome, but definitely worth it. Along the path there were numerous classic German houses, plus the foliage opened in parts to reveal the city below. I scuttled up to the castle but realized there was an entrance fee and a path that went even further up the hill. With curiosity and frugality, I continued upward.

Greeting me at the top was quite the surprise. There was a whole developed section up there with restaurants and viewing platforms in various directions. I ate here and purchased my first German beer. Furthermore, the trail continued even higher to the peak where an old tower perched.

The way down was speedy, and I pleased enough by the top of the hill that I didn't really consider going into the Shloss Drachenburg, although I'm sure it's nice.

## Cologne

Bonn and Cologne are only about 30km from each other, and there is convenient, cheap train transport between the two, so on another weekend I eagerly headed over there. Awaiting me was the single most awe-inspiring moments of my summer: Immediately after stepping out of the Cologne main station, the Cologne Cathedral towers above. I wasn't ready for how tall this structure is. Not only that, but its shocking intricate and deep.

In the square in front of the cathedral, I ate my pb&j, surrounded by tourist groups and street artists. To me, the cathedral is such a confusing place. Immediately amazing and imposing, it is a marvel of human creation, and yet it is a church. Supposedly made for God and yet undoubtedly used to declare the glory of its creators. Filled with tourists, pricey souvenirs, and religious symbolism. A prayer room is available for those who wish to use it, but I saw one other person in there, while hundreds gawk at the ceilings elsewhere. Nonetheless, I loved my experience there, especially gawking at the ceilings. I couldn't help but feel a bit perplexed, but I'm sure there are some people and articles that understand the intricacies of what the church represents better than me.

### Museum Ludwig

A modern art museum, the Ludwig has a large collection of works from names like Picasso and Salvador Dali. It was gorgeous in some places, wacky in others, and thought provoking throughout. From a piece of bread in one room, to a mosaic in another, I never knew what to expect. Armed with a first year art history course, I tried my best to get as much as I could from it, but, while enjoyable, it gets tiring. After the white museum walls, I needed some fresh air.

### Cologne Triangle

Next on my list was to get a good view of the city. A tower named the Cologne Triangle provides a viewing platform to see all around the city. To get there I crossed the Cologne bridge, which is fixed with thousands of locks engraved with the names of lovers. There is hardly any space for a single extra lock.

After crossing the bridge and waiting in short line at the tower, I took an elevator and some stairs up to the viewing platform of the Triangle. Here I was exposed to a 360 degree view of the city and some of its more iconic views.

## Groceries

Something I was not aware of before going to Germany was the amount of excellent discount grocery stores there are. Stores like Aldi and Lidl are all over the place and provide good food for quite cheap, including lots of fun products that a Canadian kid was oblivious to. Various kinds of chocolate, chips, drinks, cheese, and more could all be found for about a Euro, and it was all pretty decent. Even fruits and vegetables could be found at these prices. My absolute favorite chocolates were Ritter Sports, particularly the cocoa mousse flavour. One product in particular that was missing was peanut butter, but they always had shelves filled with Nutella.

Much later, I was able to have a conversation back home with someone who grew up in Germany, and he said that these stores are not only cheap, but they actually have some of the highest quality foods that can be found in grocery stores. Good thing, because these little discoveries ended up keeping me alive and entertained whenever I was in Bonn. However, I was soon to head to Marburg for a 2-week language course, which would provide an entirely new social and culinary experience.
