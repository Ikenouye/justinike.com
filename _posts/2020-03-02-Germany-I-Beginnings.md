One of the original intentions for this blog was to relay and remember information about what I was doing abroad last summer. That obviously didn't happen, so, before everything escapes my mind (I imagine much of it already has), I'll dive into that original intention. 

## The Setup

Sometime into my third year of university, I had a few conversations with a friend about the crazy things he did over the previous summer. He had gone to Germany on a scholarship, visiting some of Europe and doing degree related work. Upon seeing my interest, he guided me towards [DAAD Research in Science and Engineering](https://www.daad.de/rise/en/). DAAD, a Germam academic exchange service, provides summer internships between international undergraduate students and doctoral researchers. 

I gathered some references, applied, and waited. A few months later I got word back that I was accepted into the program and that I'd be located at the University of Bonn! After my semester and a week or so at home, I was on a flight across the ocean.

## Hello Germany

My first moments in the country were quite the mixed bag. With a couple winks of sleep, I arrived in Frankfurt, which is nearly 200km away from Bonn, so I had to catch a train. Thankfully there was a long distance train station right in the airport, so buying a ticket and getting to the platform wasn't too bad. I got pretty confused by the train scheduling signs, but a patient lady helped me out. 

The train ride to Bonn was the nicest introduction to Germany I could have asked for. The route from Frankfurt to Bonn stays right along the Rhine River, and it was a lovely sunny day. I gawked at the farm land rolling over the hills, the communities tucked between them, and the castles standing strong over them.

Finally, I was in Bonn, but one major step remained. I had to use public transit to get to my hostel for the night. This task took mcuh too long. I was tired, stressed, and just confused. After recognizing that the U-Bahn is the local train system, I took one in the wrong direction. I eventually found my way to the proper station and rested for the night.

The morning after, I made my way just one U-Bahn stop further to the dorm building in which I would be living for the next 3 months. It was a quaint situation, but it was enough. One great thing it did have was a large square widow that opened both from the top and the side and viewed a lush canopy of trees. 

## The Internship

Now onto the actual purpose of my trip. I was in the theoretical computer science department at the University of Bonn. There I worked under a researcher going for his doctorate. I was introduced to scientific paper that was, and remains, way over my head and a pleasant research group, with whom I was able to have lunch and cake with occasionally. 

My first few weeks were dedicated to getting a basic grasp on the paper. Essentially, it had to do with optimization of graph traversal, in which there are a group of nodes with connections between them with weights. Think a map of cities with highways of different distances between them. There were a variety of methods for obtaining structures from these graphs to speed up the process which I helped implement into a program. I then compared their performances. All this took a lot of time, with the program having a lot of dependencies and the running times of it being maxed out at about 4 hours or just running out of memory. At the end of it, I was able to give some results to my supervisor. 

## First Discoveries

Bonn isn't one of the larger, better known cities of Germany, but it has its share of history and attractions nonetheless. Most notably, it was the birthplace of Beethoven. At the time of my visit, there was a celebration of this, with herds of little Beethoven statues arranged in the city square.

Once you make your way to the center of the city, it's easy to walk around the expansive green spaces, the edge of Rhine, and a dedicated walking area containing all the shops and restaurants you need. Other points of attraction in the city center are the Bonner Münster church and the house in which Beethoven grew up, both of which were unfortunately under construction at the time of my visit.

The next few months had a lot in store for me, including a language course, a conference, and a few other adventures. This post only outlines my first little while in Bonn, so next I'll be digging deeper into the city.
