After the language course, the next event of the summer was a conference for all the interns in Heidelberg, home of Germany's oldest university and a great tourist destination. The following week I was able to go the Berlin with my sister, among other activities around Bonn. These make up the last largely notable events of my time in Germany before heading home, meaning that this is the (nearly 2 years later) conclusion to the Germany series!

## Heidelberg

### Day 1

Again I took the lovely train ride down the Rhine, this time with another intern who was at my university. Circumventing Frankfurt, we headed south to Heidelberg, the location of the DAAD conference. There were many more of us than I knew about, but I was happy to quickly find my friends from the Marburg language group. After a quick introductory event, we indulged in a BBQ feast (Germans like their bbq). For a beverage, I enjoyed a Mezzo-mix, a mixture of cola and orange pop, which works surprisingly well.

After getting our fill, we went on an evening walk. As we crossed the river, we witnessed a gorgeous sunset that kept us on the bridge until after dark.

### Day 2

The next morning was committed to presentations from interns' projects. I didn't present, but there was a spectrum of presentations from computer science to geology to engineering research.

In the afternoon, they provided us with a tour of the town and its castle. Heidelberg is a very pretty, simple town with lots of history in the university and a rivalry between the Catholics and the Protestants. One such piece of Heidelberg history is Robert Bunsen's invention of the Bunsen burner.

As you can see, Heidelberg is very photogenic, orange roofs amidst green hills split by a river. The orange roofs host an assortment of churches, shops, and university buildings; the hills are occupied by a castle, and the river is crossed by a multi-arched bridge.

### Day 3

There were no plans for day 3, so we were free to explore. Our exploration took us to a little hike on the  opposite side of the river from the castle and the majority of the town, providing a great view of both. Aimless wandering followed, allowing us to witness a handcycle race and walk through a flea market. This town is also where I got to try currywurst for the first time, a German fast food dish consisting of sausage with curry ketchup.

After saying goodbye to the language group, I boarded a train. Heading back to Bonn again provided me fleeting views of smaller towns I'll never know the names of.

## Berlin

My sister was able to join me in Germany for a week around mid-July. She first came to Bonn, which allowed me to explore it with even more depth, seeing a German history museum and a very unique mathematics and computing museum.

However, our main excursion was to Berlin, the capital of Germany. After making a quick pit-stop in Cologne, we took an amazingly cheap flight to Berlin, where we were greeted by a distant relative. This relative gave us a fantastic experience we would be unlikely to have without a local guide. In just one weekend we visited Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag, the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, sections of the Berlin wall including the East Side Gallery, museum island, the distinctly different west and east sides of the city, and so much more.

This is a city that has been torn down, built back up, split apart, and reunited. History bursts from every street, with a monument popping up whichever way you wander. Details are not hidden; the injustices committed on Berlin's very soil are recognized again and again. I gained a lot of respect for Germany here. They owed up to the past, and thanked those who made the ultimate sacrifice.

The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe is particularly thought provoking, with dark monoliths towering over uneven ground. You become lost in the forest of stone, where the sounds of the city are suffocated and claustrophobia strikes. It's not pretty, but it is an integral part of the city. They made it hard to ignore, simple, and effective.

Viewing this harsh subject matter was made easier with my sister. We were able to unpack everything, bounce thoughts off each other, and still have a great time. Together we got to relax by the river, try fun treats, and take awkward photos.

## Loose Ends

After these events, I went through a period in which I ended up doing small activities in Bonn, rather than going on larger trips across the country. This included finding little parks or markets and trying out random food from the local discount grocery store (3 pizzas for 2 Euros!). Also, this summer happened to be one of record breaking heat, relegating me to my room with a pail of ice cream. By this time, I was ready for home.

My trip was capped off by a bittersweet flight with a friend from the Marburg language group. It was a great way to reflect upon our summers and get us home. I even got to meet some of his family at his stop, before taking the last leg of the trip solo.

## Conclusion

Nearly two years later, I was able to retain lots of these memories and feelings from my brain and the pictures I took. I'm now able to see just how rare of an opportunity this was. Many parts of it scared me at the time, being across the ocean alone. This fear may have caused me to go on less expeditions than I could have, but I don't regret the decisions I made. I found out how I like to travel, building self awareness and core competencies along the way. Many of the brightest moments are those where I was joined by family and new friends. When the time is right, I'll get out there again, ready to meet more people and try new grocery stores.
