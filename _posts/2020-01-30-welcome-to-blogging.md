The idea to have a blog came about when I was soon to go overseas for a summer internship. I wanted to create a platform where the people who wanted to keep up with what I was doing could, and the people who didn't wouldn't be pushed in the face with it. That summer has since passed, but my desire to reflect upon that time and document where I'm at has not.

About a week after starting serious web development (and months of researching and restarting), here I am. Now I actually have to write.

### The Purpose

I want to document what I'm up to. The anticipated results of this come two-fold: 

1. My thoughts and feelings towards things become more developed to help shape what I enjoy and excel at, assisting my current self
2. I am able to look back at previous content and track my learning, informing my future self

I've realized that I always need something to work on, something that accompanies my mind throughout the day and has a product. Coming out of university, I have to be purposeful in fulfilling this necessity, as to continue to grow and learn. Various projects and milestones already form a checklist for me to complete, so I just have to get started. The first on that list was this website, which will assist the rest. 

### The Means

The concept of documentation over creation is something that permeates the world of content creators, and I think it's valuable to me for kick-starting my process here. It allows me to start writing and obtain a product. Documentation means that the content here is merely a log, while creation will continue off of that process, getting me to next check boxes on that list. I wish for the creation to occur in parallel with the blog, benefiting both their progressions.

Here is what that documentation will likely include:

- Development updates
- Reflections on periods of my life
- Information on my current projects and interests
- Some basic guides on programming and technology

Now this all sounds very serious, and that is because I mean for this to be a very purposeful and helpful tool. Time for me to get to work on making that a reality.
