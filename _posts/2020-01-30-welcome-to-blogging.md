The idea to have a blog came about when I was soon to go overseas for a summer internship. I wanted to create a platform where the people that wanted to keep up with what I was doing could, and the people who didn't wouldn't be pushed in the face with it. 

That summer has since passed, but my desire to share and reflect upon that time has not. Furthermore, I have various other topics I wish to unpack.

About a week after starting serious Jekyll work, here we are.
